.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B pbsfs
command is used to print or manipulate the PBS scheduler's fairshare usage data.
Some options should only be used when the scheduler is not running.  There are
multiple parts to a fairshare node and you can print these data in different
formats.  The 
.B pbsfs 
command must be run by root; otherwise it will print the error message, 
"Unable to access fairshare data".


The data:
.br
.IP "fairshare entity" 10
the entity in the fairshare tree.  
.IP group 10
the group ID the node is in (i.e. the node's parent).
.IP cgroup 10
the group ID of this group
.IP shares 10
the number of shares the group has
.IP usage 10
the amount of usage
.IP percentage 10
The percentage of the tree belonging to the entity.  Note that only
the leaf nodes sum to 100%.  If all of the nodes are summed, the
result will be greater then 100%.  Only the leaf nodes of the tree are
fairshare entities.
.IP "usage / perc" 10
The value the scheduler will use to the pick which entity has
priority over another.  The smaller the number the higher the priority.
.IP "Path from root" 
The path from the root of the tree to the node.  This
is useful because the scheduler will look down the path to compare two nodes
to see which has the higher priority.  
.IP resource 10
The resource for which the scheduler accumulates usage for its fairshare 
calculations.  This defaults to cput (cpu seconds) but can be set in the 
scheduler's config file.
.LP

.SH OPTIONS

.B Scheduler can be running:
.IP "-t" 10
print the fairshare tree in a hierarchical format.
.IP "-p" 10
print the fairshare tree in a flat format with more data.
.IP "-g entity" 10
print one entry with all data and print the path from the root of the tree to
the node.
.IP "-c entity1 entity2" 10
compare two fairshare entities
.LP

.B Scheduler must be down:
.IP "-s entity usage_value" 10
set 
.I entity's 
usage value to 
.I usage_value.  
Please note that editing a
non-leaf node is ignored.  All non-leaf node usage values are calculated each
time the scheduler is run/HUPed.
.IP "-d" 10
decay the fairshare tree (divide all values in half)
.IP "-e" 10
trim fairshare tree to just the entities in the resource_group file
.LP

.B Scheduler can be running or down:
.IP "--version" 10
The 
.B pbsfs
command returns its PBS version information and exits.
This option can only be used alone.
