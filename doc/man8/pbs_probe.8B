- report PBS diagnostic information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pbs_probe 
[ -f | -v ] 
.br
.B pbs_probe
--version
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Deprecated.
The
.B pbs_probe
command reports post-installation information that is useful for PBS
diagnostics. Aside from the direct information that is supplied on the
command line,
.B pbs_probe
uses as the source for basic information the file
/etc/pbs.conf and the values of any of the following environment variable
that may be set in the environment in which
.B pbs_probe
is run: PBS_CONF_FILE, PBS_HOME, PBS_EXEC, PBS_START_SERVER, PBS_START_MOM,
and PBS_START_SCHED.
.LP
In order to execute
.B pbs_probe,
the user must have PBS Operation or Manager privilege.
.LP
Used without options, the
.B pbs_probe
runs in "report" mode. In this mode
.B pbs_probe
reports on any errors in the PBS infrastructure files that it
detects. The problems are categorized, and a list of the problem messages
placed in each category are output. Those categories which are empty do not
show in the output.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-f " 10
Run in "fix" mode. In this mode pbs_probe will examine each of the relevant
infrastructure files and, where possible, fix any errors that it detects,
and print a message of what got changed. If it is unable to fix a problem,
it will simply print a message regarding what was detected. 
.IP "-v" 10
Run in "verbose" mode. If the verbose option is turned on, pbs_probe will
also output a complete list of the infrastructure files that it checked.
.LP
.IP "--version" 10
The 
.B pbs_probe
command returns its PBS version information and exits.
This option can only be used alone.

.SH STANDARD ERROR
The
.B pbs_probe
command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.LP
.SH FILES
/etc/pbs.conf
.br
/etc/init.d/pbs
