.SH NAME
.B tracejob 
- print log messages for a PBS job
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tracejob 
[-a] [-c count] [-f filter] [-l] [-m] [-n days] 
.RS 9
[-p path] 
[-s] [-v] [-w cols] [-z] jobid
.RE
.B tracejob
--version
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tracejob
command extracts log messages for a given jobid and  prints
them in chronological order.
.LP
Log messages contain server, scheduler, accounting and MOM information.
Server logs contain information such as when a job was queued or modified.
Scheduler logs contain clues as to why a job is not running.  Accounting
logs contain accounting records for when a job was queued, started, ended
or deleted.  MOM logs contain information about what happened to a job
while it was running.  
.LP
To get MOM log messages for a job, 
.B tracejob 
must be run on the machine 
on which the job ran.
.LP
All users have access to server, scheduler and MOM information. Only 
Administrator or root can access accounting information.
.LP
Some log messages appear many times.  In order to make the output of 
.B tracejob
more readable, messages that appear over a certain number of times (see option 
.B -c 
below) are restricted to only the most recent message.

If 
.B tracejob 
is run on a job array, the information returned will be about
the job array itself, and not its subjobs.  Job arrays do not have associated
MOM log messages.  If 
.B tracejob 
is run on a subjob, the same types of log 
messages will be available as for a job.  Certain log messages that occur for 
a regular job will not occur for a subjob.

Note that some shells require that you enclose a job array identifier in
double quotes.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a" 15
Do not report accounting information.
.IP "-c <count>" 15  
Set excessive message limit to 
.I count.
If a message is logged 
at least 
.I count
times, only the most recent message is printed.
The default for 
.I count
is 15.
.IP "-f <filter>" 15
Do not include log events of type 
.I filter.
The 
.B -f 
option can be used 
more than once on the command line.  
.RS
.IP "filter values:" 5
Filter values can be any of: 
.I error, system, admin, job, job_usage, security, sched, debug, 
.I debug2, resv, debug3, 
or 
.I debug4,
or their equivalent in hexadecimal.
The following table shows the hex value and category
for each filter.

.nf

resv       0200       Reservation debug messages
debug3     0400       Less common than debug2
debug4     0800       Less common than debug3
