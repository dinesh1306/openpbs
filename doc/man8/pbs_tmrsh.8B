.SH NAME
.B pbs_tmrsh 
- TM-enabled replacement for rsh/ssh for use by MPI implementations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pbs_tmrsh 
host [-l username] [-n] command [args ...]
.br
.B pbs_tmrsh 
--version

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pbs_tmrsh
command attempts to emulate an "rsh" connection to the specified host,
via underlying calls to the Task Management (TM) API. The program is
intended to be used during MPI integration activities, and not by
end-users. The initial version of this program is targeted for use
with MPICH and HP-MPI. 
.LP
Running "pbs_tmrsh host command" will cause a PBS task to be started
on "host" running "command". The "host" may be in IP dot address form.
.LP
The environment variables used by the two MPI implementations
to point to the rsh work-alike (MPI_REMSH in the case of HP and
P4_RSHCOMMAND for MPICH) must be set in the job environment
and point to the full path for
.B pbs_tmrsh.
.LP
The file $PBS_HOME/pbs_environment will be used to set an environment
variable PATH to be used to search for the program executable. This
applies to both Windows and UNIX. It is expected that a full path will
be specified for the command and the PATH variable will not be needed.

Output and errors are written to the PBS job's output and error files,
not to standard output/error.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-l username" 13
Specifies the username under which to execute the task. If used, username must
match the username running the
.B pbs_tmrsh command.
.IP "-n" 13
Currently a no-op; provided for MPI implementations that expect to call
rsh with the "-n" option.
.LP
.IP "--version" 13
The 
.B pbs_tmrsh
command returns its PBS version information and exits.
This option can only be used alone.
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The
.B pbs_tmrsh
command will write a diagnostic message to the PBS job's error file for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The
.B pbs_tmrsh
program will exit with the exit status of the remote command or with
255 if an error occurred. This is because ssh works this way.
