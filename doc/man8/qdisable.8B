.TH qdisable 8B "23 August 2011" Local "PBS Professional"
.SH NAME
.B qdisable 
- disable input to a PBS destination
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qdisable 
destination ...
.br
.B qdisable
--version
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qdisable
command directs that a destination should no longer accept batch jobs.
If the command is accepted, the destination will no longer accept
.I "Queue Job"
requests which specified the disabled queue.  Jobs which already reside
in the queue will continue to be processed.  This allows a queue to be
"drained."
.LP
In order to execute qdisable, the user must have PBS Operation or Manager
privilege.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--version" 8
The 
.B qdisable
command returns its PBS version information and exits.
This option can only be used alone.

.SH  OPERANDS
The qdisable command accepts one or more
.I destination
operands.  The operands are one of three forms:
.RS 5
.B queue
.br
.B @server
.br
.B queue@server
.RE
If
.B queue
is specified, the request is to disable that queue at the default server.
If the
.B @server
form is given, the request is to disable all the queues at that server.
If a full destination identifier,
.B queue@server ,
is given, the request is to disable the named queue at the named server.
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The qdisable
command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
qdisable
command, the exit status will be a value of zero.
.LP
If the qdisable command fails to process any operand, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.
