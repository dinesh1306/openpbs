.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pbs_server
command starts the operation of a batch server on the local host.
Typically, this command will be in a local boot file such as
.I /etc/rc.local .
If the batch server is already in execution, 
.B pbs_server
will exit with an error.
To insure that the 
.B pbs_server
command is not runnable by the general user community, the server
will only execute if its real and effective uid is zero.
.LP
The server will record a diagnostic message in a log file for any
error occurrence.  The log files are maintained in the server_logs
directory below the home directory of the server.
If the log file cannot be opened, the diagnostic message is written
to the system console.  The server writes its PBS 
version and build information to the logfile whenever it starts up or 
the logfile is rolled to a new file.

To kill the server: 
.br
UNIX/Linux:
.RS
qterm (see
.B qterm(8B)) 
.br
or 
.br
"kill <server_pid>", which sends a SIGTERM.
.RE
Windows: 
.RS
if you're running "pbs_server -N" for a standalone mode server,
use <cntrl>-<break>.
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a T|F " 10
When true, the server is in state "active" and the scheduler is called
to schedule jobs.
When false, the server is in state "idle" and the scheduler is not called
to schedule jobs.
Sets the server's 
.I scheduling 
attribute.
If the 
.I -a T|F
option is not specified, the server uses the prior value for the 
.I scheduling
attribute.
Valid values: True, t, T, 1, False, f, F, 0.

.IP "-A acctfile" 10
Specifies an absolute path name for the file to use as the accounting file.
If not specified, the file is named for the current date in the
PBS_HOME/server_priv/accounting directory.

.IP "-C" 10
The server starts up, creates the database, and exits.  Windows only.

.IP "-d config_path" 10
Specifies the path of the directory which is home to the servers
configuration files, PBS_HOME.  A host may have multiple servers.  Each server
must have a different configuration directory.
The default configuration directory is given by the symbol $PBS_HOME
which is typically 
.I /usr/spool/PBS .

.IP "-e mask"
Specifies a log event mask to be used when logging.  See "log_events" in the
pbs_server_attributes(7B) man page.

.IP "-F seconds"
Specifies the number of seconds that the secondary server should wait 
before taking over when it believes the primary server is down.  If 
the number of seconds is specified as -1, the secondary will make one
attempt to contact the primary and then become active.
Default: 30 seconds.

.IP "-L logfile"
Specifies an absolute path name of the file to use as the log file.
If not specified, the file is one named for the current date in the
PBS_HOME/server_logs directory, see the
.I -d
option.

.IP "-M mom_port"
Specifies the host name and/or port number on which the server should connect
the job executor, MOM.  The option argument,
.I mom_conn ,
is one of the forms: host_name, [:]port_number, or host_name:port_number.
If host_name not specified, the local host is assumed.   If port_number is not
specified, the default port is assumed.  See the -M option for pbs_mom(8).  
Default: 15002.

.IP "-N" 10
The server runs in standalone mode. In Windows, it does not register
as a Windows service.  On other platforms, MOM will not detach from the 
current session. 

.IP "-p port" 10
Specifies the port number on which the server will
listen for batch requests.
If multiple servers are running on a
single host, each must have its own unique port number.
This option is for use in testing with multiple batch systems on a single host.
Default: 15001.

.IP "-R mom_RPPport"
Specifies the port number on which the server should query the up/down
status of Mom.    See the -R option for pbs_mom(8).  Default: 15003.

.IP "-s replacement_string" 10
Specifies the string to use when replacing spaces in accounting 
entity names.  Only available under Windows.  See the 
.B PBS Professional Administrator's Guide.

.IP "-S scheduler_port" 10
Specifies the port number to which the server should connect when
contacting the Scheduler.  The option argument,
.I scheduler_conn ,
is of the same syntax as under the -M option.  Default: 15004.

.IP "-t type"
Specifies the impact on jobs when the server restarts.
.I type
argument is:
.RS
.IP cold 7
All jobs are purged.  Positive confirmation is required before
this direction is accepted.

.IP create 7
The server will discard any existing configuration files: server, nodes, queues
and jobs,
and initialize configuration files to the default values.  The server is
idled (scheduling set false).

.IP hot 7
All jobs in the Running state are retained in that state.
Any job that was requeued into the Queued state from the Running state
when the server last shut down
will be run immediately, assuming the required resources are available.
This returns the server to the same state as when it went down.
After those jobs are restarted, then normal scheduling takes place
for all remaining queued jobs.
All other jobs are retained in their current state.

.IP
If a job cannot be restarted immediately because of a missing resource, such
as a node being down,  the server will attempt to restart it periodically for
up to 5 minutes.   After that period, the server will revert to a normal state,
as if warm started, and will no longer attempt to restart any remaining jobs
which were running prior to the shutdown.

.IP updatedb 7
Updates format of PBS data from the previous format to the
data service format.

.IP warm 7
All jobs in the Running state are retained in that state.
All other jobs are maintained in their current state.
The job scheduler will typically make new selections for which
jobs are placed into execution.  Warm is the default if -t is not specified.


.RE
.LP
.IP "--version" 10
The 
.B pbs_server
command returns its PBS version information and exits.
This option can only be used alone.

.SH FILES
.IP $PBS_HOME/server_priv 10
default directory for configuration files.

.IP $PBS_HOME/server_logs 10
directory for log files recorded by the server.


.SH Signal Handling
On receipt of the following signals, the server performs the defined action:

.IP SIGHUP
The current server log and accounting log are closed and reopened.  This 
allows for the prior log to be renamed and a new log started from the time
of the signal.

.IP SIGTERM
Causes a rapid orderly shutdown of pbs_server, identical to "qterm -t quick".

.IP SIGSHUTDN
On systems (Unicos) where SIGSHUTDN is defined, it also causes an orderly
"quick" shutdown of the server.

.IP "SIGPIPE, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2"
These signals are ignored.
.LP
All other signals have their default behavior installed.


.SH EXIT STATUS
If the server command fails to begin batch operation, the
server exits with a value greater than zero.
