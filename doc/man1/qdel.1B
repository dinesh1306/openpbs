.SH NAME
.B qdel 
- deletes PBS jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qdel 
[-x] 
[\-Wforce | -Wsuppress_email=<N>] 
.RS 6
job_identifier [job_identifier ...]
.RE
.B qdel
--version
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B qdel 
command deletes jobs in the order given, whether they are at the local
server or at a remote server.  

The qdel command is used without options to delete queued, running,
held, or suspended jobs, while the
.I -x  
option gives it the additional capacity to delete finished or moved
jobs.  With the
.I -x 
option, this command can be used on finished and moved jobs, in
addition to queued, running, held, or suspended jobs.

When this command is used without the 
.I -x 
option, if job history is enabled, the deleted job's history is
retained.  The 
.I -x 
option is used to additionally remove the history of the job being
deleted.

.LP
A PBS job may be deleted by its owner, an operator, or the
administrator.  The server deletes a PBS job by sending a 
.B SIGTERM
signal, then, if there are remaining processes, a
.B SIGKILL 
signal.  

If someone other than the job's owner deletes the job, mail is
sent to the job's owner, or to a list of mail recipients if 
specified during 
.B qsub.  
See the 
.B qsub(1B)
man page.
.LP

.B "How Behavior of qdel Command Can Be Affected"
.RS 3
The server's 
.I default_qdel_arguments
attribute may affect the behavior of the 
.B qdel 
command.  This attribute is settable by the administrator 
via the 
.B qmgr
command.  The attribute may be set to "-Wsuppress_email=<N>".
The server attribute is overridden by command line arguments.
See the 
.B pbs_server_attributes(1B) 
man page.

If the job is in the process of provisioning,
it can be deleted only by using the 
.I -W force
option.
