.SH NAME
.B pbs_node_attributes 
\- attributes of PBS vnodes


.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The vnode attributes listed are divided into those that can be set by
an Operator or Manager, and those that are read-only.

.B Settable Attributes
.br
Unless otherwise specified, the following attributes are readable by all, 
and can be set by a Manager only.

.IP comment
This attribute can be set to any string to inform the users
of any information relating to the node.   If this attribute is not explicitly
set, the PBS Server will use the attribute to pass information about the node
status, specifically why the node is down.  If the attribute is explicitly set
by the manager, it will not be modified by the Server.

.IP ntype
This attribute defines the type of the vnode.   
Currently there are two types
of vnodes supported:
.RS
.IP PBS
PBS vnodes are the default type and are assumed to run multiple jobs. The
placement of the jobs
among them is controlled by the site policy defined in the Job Scheduler.
.IP globus
PBS no longer supports Globus.  The Globus functionality has been

True, the vnode can be used for reservations.  Existing reservations
are not automatically removed when this attribute is set to False.

.br
Python attribute value type: 

.IP sharing

vnode's or host's unused resources are available to other jobs.  This attribute is set in Version 2 configuration files via the 
.B pbs_mom -s insert 
command.  
.br

.br
Format: String.
.br

.br
Default value: default_share.
.br
Python attribute value type: int
.sp
The behavior of a vnode or host is determined by a combination of its 
.I sharing
attribute and a job's placement directive.  The behavior is defined
as follows:
.nf

                |when place=...   |when place=...

("*") may be set by the manager or operator; the other states
are set internally.  
.br
Format: String containing comma-separated list of one or more states.
.br
Python attribute value type: int
.RS 
.IP "free"
Node is up and capable of accepting additional job(s).

The entire vnode has been exclusively allocated to one job at the job's request.
.IP busy
The vnode is reporting a load average greater than the configured high water
value.
.IP stale
Server can still communicate with MOM, but MOM is not reporting any information.
.IP state-unknown
The Server has never been able to contact the node.  Either pbs_mom is not
running on the node, the node hardware is down, or there is a network problem.
.IP provisioning
The vnode is in the process of being provisioned.
.IP resv-exclusive
The vnode has been allocated to a reservation that requested exclusive use 
of the vnode, and the reservation is running.
.IP unresolvable
The server cannot resolve the name of the vnode.
.IP wait-provisioning
This vnode needs to be provisioned, but cannot because the maximum number 
of concurrently provisioning vnodes has been reached.  See the
