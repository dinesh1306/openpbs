.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B pbs_rsub
command is used to create an advance or standing reservation.
An advance reservation reserves specific 
resources for the requested time period, and a standing reservation
reserves specific resources for recurring time periods.  When 
a reservation is created, it has an associated queue.

After the reservation is requested, it is either confirmed or denied.
Once the reservation has been confirmed, authorized users submit jobs to the 
reservation's queue via
.B qsub 
and 
.B qmove.

A confirmed reservation will accept jobs at any time.
The jobs in its queue can run only during the reservation 
period, whether during a single advance reservation or 
during the occurrences of a standing reservation.

When an advance reservation ends, all of its jobs are
deleted, whether running or queued.  When an occurrence of a 
standing reservation ends, only its running jobs are deleted; 
those jobs still in the queue are not deleted.

To get information about a reservation, use the 
.B pbs_rstat 
command.

To delete a reservation, use the 
.B pbs_rdel 
command.  Do not use the
.B qdel 
command.

The behavior of the 
.B pbs_rsub 
command may be affected by 
any site hooks.  Site hooks can modify the reservation's attributes.


.SH REQUIREMENTS

When using
.B pbs_rsub
to request a reservation, you must specify two of the following 
options: 
.I -R, -E, 
and
.I -D.
The resource request 
.I -l walltime
can be used instead of the 
.I -D 
option.

If you want to run jobs in a reservation that will request exclusive placement,
you must create the reservation with exclusive placement via -l place=excl.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-D duration" 8
.RS
.LP
Specifies reservation duration. If the start
time and end time are the only times specified, this duration time is
calculated.  
.br
Format: Either a total number of seconds of walltime, or
a colon-delimited duration, e.g. HH:MM:SS or MM:SS.  
.br
Default: none.
.RE
.IP "-E end_time" 8
.RS
.LP
Specifies the reservation end time.  If start time and duration are
the only times specified, the end time value is calculated.    
.br
Format: Datetime. See 
.B FORMATS
for a description of the datetime string.
.br
Default: none.
.RE
.IP "-g group_list" 8
.RS
.LP
The 
.I group_list 
is a comma-separated list of group names. The reservation creator's
primary group is automatically added to this list.
The server uses entries on this list, along with an ordered set 
of rules, to associate a group name with the reservation. 
.br
Format: group@hostname[,group@hostname ...]
.RE
.IP "-G auth_group_list" 8
.RS
.LP
Comma-separated list of names of groups who
can or cannot submit jobs to this reservation.  Group names are
interpreted in the context of the server's host, not the context of the host 
from which the job is submitted. This list becomes the 
.I acl_groups 
list for the 
reservation's queue. 
More specific entries should be listed before more general, because the
list is read left-to-right, and the first match determines access.
Refer to the 
.I Authorized_Groups 
reservation attribute on the 
pbs_resv_attributes(7B) man page.  
If both 
.I Authorized_Users
and 
.I Authorized_Groups
are set, a user must belong to both in order to be able to 
submit jobs to this reservation.
If the reservation creator specifies this list, the creator's 
group is not automatically added to the list.
.br
Format: [+|-]group_name[,[+|-]group_name ...]
.br
Default: All groups are authorized to submit jobs.
.RE
.IP "-H auth_host_list" 8
.RS
.LP
Comma-separated list of hosts from which jobs can and cannot be 
submitted to this reservation.  This list becomes the 
.I acl_hosts 
list for the reservation's queue. 
More specific entries should be listed before more general, because the
list is read left-to-right, and the first match determines access.
If the reservation creator specifies this list, the creator's 
host is not automatically added to the list.
See the 
.I Authorized_Hosts 
reservation attribute on the pbs_resv_attributes(7B) man page.
.br
Format: [+|-]hostname[,[+|-]hostname ...]
.br
Default: All hosts are authorized to submit jobs.
.RE
.IP "-I block_time"
.RS
.LP
Specifies interactive mode.  The 
.B pbs_rsub 
command will block, up to 
.I block_time 
seconds, while waiting for the reservation request to be 
confirmed or denied.

If 
.I block_time
is positive, and the reservation isn't confirmed or denied in 
the specified time, the ID string for the reservation is returned 
with the status "UNCONFIRMED".

If 
.I block_time
is negative, and the scheduler doesn't confirm or deny the reservation in 
the specified time, the reservation is deleted.

Format: Integer.
.br
Default: Not interactive.

.RE

.IP "-l placement" 8
.RS
.LP

The 
.I placement
specifies how vnodes are reserved. 
The 
.I place
statement can contain the following elements, in any order:
.IP " " 5
-l place=[
.I arrangement
][:
.I sharing
][:
.I grouping]
.LP
where
.IP " " 5
.I arrangement 
is one of 
.I free
|
.I pack
|
.I scatter
| 
.I vscatter
.br
.I sharing
is one of 
.I excl 
| 
.I share 
| 
.I exclhost
.br
.I grouping 
can have only one instance of 
.I group=resource
.LP
and where
.IP " " 5
.I free:
Use any vnode(s) for reservation.
.br
.I pack:
All chunks are taken from one host.
.br
.I scatter:
Only one chunk with any MPI processes will be taken from a host.
A chunk with no MPI processes may be taken from the same node as
another chunk.
.br
.I vscatter:
Only one chunk is taken from any vnode.
.br
.I excl:
Only this reservation uses the vnodes chosen.
.br
.I exclhost:
The entire host is allocated to the reservation.
.br
.I share:
This reservation can share the vnodes chosen.
.br
.I group=resource:
Chunks will be grouped according to a 
.I resource.  
All nodes in the group must have a common value for the 
.I resource, 
which can be either the built-in resource
.I host
or a site-defined node-level resource.

The place statement cannot begin with a colon.

Note that nodes can have sharing attributes that override
job placement requests.  See the
.B pbs_node_attributes(7B)
man page.
.LP
For more on reservations, see 
.B The PBS Professional User's Guide.

.RE

.IP "-l resource_request" 8
.RS
.LP
The 
.I resource_request 
specifies the resources required for the reservation. These 
resources will be used for the limits on the queue that is dynamically created 
for the reservation. The aggregate amount of resources for currently 
running jobs from this queue will not exceed these resource limits. Jobs in the queue that 
request more of a resource than the queue limit for that resource are not 
allowed to run. Also, the queue inherits the value of any resource limit set 
on the server, and these are used for the job if the reservation request 
itself is silent about that resource.
A non-privileged user cannot submit a reservation requesting a custom resource which has
been created to be invisible or read-only for users.

Resources are requested
by using the
.I -l
option, either in
.I chunks
inside of
.I selection statements,
or in job-wide requests using
.I resource_name=value
pairs.
The
.I selection statement
is of the form:
.IP
.I -l select=[N:]chunk[+[N:]chunk ...]
.LP
where
.I N
specifies how many of that chunk, and
a
.I chunk
is of the form:
.IP
.I resource_name=value[:resource_name=value ...]
.LP
Job-wide
.I resource_name=value
requests are of the form:
.IP
.I -l resource_name=value[,resource_name=value ...]
.LP
.RE

.IP "-m mail_points" 8
.RS
.LP
Specifies the set of events that cause mail to be sent to the 
list of users specified in the 
.I -M mail_list
option. 
.br
Format: string consisting of 1) any 
combination of "a", "b", "c" or "e", or 2) the single character "n".
.br
.IP a
Notify if the reservation is terminated for whatever reason
.IP b
Notify when the reservation period begins
.IP c 
Notify when the reservation is confirmed
.IP e 
Notify when the reservation period ends
.IP n
Send no mail.  Cannot be used with any of 
.I a, b, c
or 
.I e.
.LP
Default: "ac".
.RE

.IP "-M mail_list" 8
.RS
.LP
The list of users to whom mail is sent 
whenever the reservation transitions to one of the states 
specified in the 
.I -m mail_points
option. 
.br
Format: user[@hostname][,user[@hostname]...]
.br
Default: reservation's owner.
.RE
.IP "-N reservation_name" 8
.RS
.LP
This specifies a name for the reservation. 
.br
Format: String up to 236 characters in length. It must consist of printable, non-white space 
characters with the first character alphabetic.
.br
Default: None.
.RE
.IP "-q destination" 8
.RS
.LP
Specifies the destination server at which to create the reservation. 
.br
Default: The default server is used if this option is not selected.
.RE

.IP "-r recurrence_rule" 8
.RS
Specifies rule for recurrence of standing reservations.  Rule must conform to iCalendar
syntax, and is specified using a subset of parameters from RFC 2445.
.br
Valid syntax for the 
.I recurrence_rule 
takes one of two forms:
.RS 5
"FREQ=
.I freq_spec;
COUNT=
.I count_spec;
.I interval_spec"
.RE
.br
or
.br
.RS 5
"FREQ=
.I freq_spec;
UNTIL=
.I until_spec; interval_spec"
.RE
.br
where
.RS 5
.IP freq_spec 15
Frequency with which the standing reservation repeats.  Valid values are:
.br
WEEKLY|DAILY|HOURLY

.IP count_spec 15
The exact number of occurrences.  Number up to 4 digits in length.  
Format: integer.

.IP interval_spec 15
Specifies interval.  Format is one or both of:
.br
BYDAY = MO|TU|WE|TH|FR|SA|SU 
.br
or
.br
BYHOUR = 0|1|2|...|23
.br
When using both, separate them with a semicolon.
.br
Elements specified in the recurrence rule override those 
specified in the arguments to the 
.I -R 
and 
.I -E
options.  For example, the 
.I BYHOUR 
specification overrides the hourly part of the
.I -R
option.  For example, 
.br
-R 0730 -E 0830 ... BYHOUR=9
.br
results in a reservation that starts at 9:30 and runs for 1 hour.
See the 
.B PBS Professional User's Guide.

.IP until_spec 15
Occurrences will start up to but not after date and time 
specified.
.br
Format: YYYYMMDD[THHMMSS] 
.br
Note that the year-month-day section is separated from 
the hour-minute-second section by a capital T.
.RE

Requirements:
.br
The recurrence rule must be on one unbroken line and must be enclosed
in double quotes.  

A start and end date must be used when specifying a recurrence rule.  
See the 
.I R
and
.I E 
options.

The PBS_TZID environment variable must be set at the submission host.  The 
format for PBS_TZID is a timezone location.  Examples: America/Los_Angeles,
America/Detroit, Europe/Berlin, Asia/Calcutta.  See the
.B PBS Professional User's Guide.

.B Examples of Standing Reservations
.br
For a reservation that runs every day from 8am to 10am, for a total of 10 occurrences:
.RS 5
pbs_rsub -R 0800 -E 1000 -r "FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10"
.RE

Every weekday from 6am to 6pm until December 10 2008
.RS 5
pbs_rsub -R 0600 -E 1800 
.br
-r "FREQ=WEEKLY; BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR; UNTIL=20081210"
.RE

Every week from 3pm to 5pm on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, for 9 occurrences, 
i.e., for three weeks:
.RS 5
pbs_rsub -R 1500 -E 1700
.br
-r "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR; COUNT=3"
.RE
.RE

.IP "-R start_time" 8
.RS
.LP
Specifies reservation starting time. If the reservation's end time 
and duration are the only times specified, this start time is calculated.

If the day,
.I DD ,
is not specified, it defaults to today if the time
.I hhmm
is in the future. Otherwise, the day is set to tomorrow.
For example, if you submit a reservation with the specification 
.I "-R 1110"
at 11:15 a.m., it is interpreted as being for 11:10am tomorrow.
If the month portion,
.I MM ,
is not specified, it defaults to the current month, provided that the specified 
day
.I DD ,
is in the future. Otherwise, the month is set to next month. Similar
rules apply to the two other optional, left-side components.

.br
Format: Datetime.
.LP
.RE
.IP "-u user_list" 8
.RS
.LP
Comma-separated list of user names.
Not used. Refer to the 
.I User_List
reservation attribute on the pbs_resv_attributes man page.
.br
Format: user[@host][,user[@host] ...]
.br
Default: None.
.RE
.IP "-U auth_user_list" 8
.RS
.LP
Comma-separated list of users who are and are not allowed to 
submit jobs to this reservation.  
This list becomes the 
.I acl_users 
attribute for the reservation's queue. 
More specific entries should be listed before more general, because the
list is read left-to-right, and the first match determines access. 
Refer to the 
.I Authorized_Users
reservation attribute on the pbs_resv_attributes man page.
If both 
.I Authorized_Users
and 
.I Authorized_Groups
are set, a user must belong to both in order to be able to 
submit jobs to this reservation.
The reservation creator's username is automatically added to this list,
whether or not the reservation creator specifies this list.
.br
Format: [+|-]user@host[,[+|-]user@host...]
.br
Default: Job owner only.
.br
.RE
.IP "-W attribute_value_list" 8
.RS
.LP
This allows you to define other attributes for the reservation.
Supported attributes:

.IP qmove=jobid 5
Converts a normal job designated by 
.I jobid
into a reservation job that will run
as soon as possible.  Creates the 
reservation with its queue and moves the job into the reservation's 
queue.  
Uses the resources requested by the job to create the reservation.  

When the reservation is created, it inherits its resources from the job, 
not from the resources requested through the
.B pbs_rsub
command.

If the
.I qmove
option is used and the the reservation is not confirmed within the 
timeout period, the reservation is deleted.  The default timeout 
period is 10 seconds.  There is no option for this kind of reservation 
to be unconfirmed.

To specify the timeout, give a negative value for the 
.I -I 
option.  For example, to specify a timeout of 300 seconds:
.RS 8
pbs_rsub -Wqmove=<job ID> -I -300
.RE 

The 
.I -R 
and 
.I -E 
options to 
.B pbs_rsub
are disabled when using the 
.I qmove=jobid
attribute.

Note that some shells require that you enclose a job array ID in double quotes.

Timeout must be specified with a negative number.
.RE

.IP "--version" 8
The 
.B pbs_rsub
command returns its PBS version information and exits.
This option can only be used alone.

.SH OUTPUT

The 
.B pbs_rsub 
command returns the reservation name.  For an advance reservation, this
has the form 
.IP
.I RNNNN.server
.LP
where 
.I NNNN 
is a unique integer.  The associated queue's name is the prefix, 
.IP
.I RNNNN.
.LP

For a standing reservation, this
has the form 
.IP
.I SNNNN.server
.LP
where 
.I NNNN 
is a unique integer.  The associated queue's name is the prefix, 
.IP
.I SNNNN
