.SH NAME
.B qrls 
\- release hold on PBS batch jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qrls
[-h\ hold_list]
job_identifier ...
.br
.B qrls
--version
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qrls
command removes or releases holds which exist on batch jobs.
.LP
A job may have one or more types of holds which make the job
ineligible for execution.
The types of holds are
.I USER ,
.I OTHER ,
.I SYSTEM, 
and
.I bad password.
The different types of holds may require
that the user issuing the 
.B qrls 
command have special privilege.
Typically, the owner of the job will be able to remove a
.I USER
hold, but not an
.I OTHER
or
.I SYSTEM 
hold.
An Attempt to release a hold for which the user does not have the
correct privilege is an error and no holds will be released for that job.
.LP
If no
.I -h
option is specified, the 
.I USER 
hold will be released.
.LP
Only root or admin can set a 
.I bad password 
hold via
.I qhold -h p.
The owner of the job can 
.I qrls -h p 
a hold set with 
.I qhold -h p.
.LP
If the job has no
.I execution_time
pending, the job will change to the 
.B queued
state.  If an 
.I execution_time
is still pending, the job will change to the
.B waiting
state.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-h hold_list" 15
Defines the types of hold to be released from the jobs.
The

option argument is a string consisting of one or more of the letters 
.I u
, 
.I o
, 
or 
.I s
in any combination, or one or more of the letters
.I n
or 
.I p.
The hold type associated with each letter is:
.RS
.IP "u - " 4
.I USER
.IP "o - " 4
.I OTHER
.IP "s - " 4
.I SYSTEM
.IP "n - " 4
.I None

double quotes.
.br
.SH STANDARD ERROR
The 
.B qrls 
command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to the
.B qrls
