.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qstat
command is used to display the status of jobs, queues, and batch servers.
The status information is written to standard output.
.LP
Status information can be displayed in a default format, an alternate format, 
or a long format, depending upon the options given.  
Default and alternate formats display all status information
for a job, queue or server on one line, in columns.  Long formats display status information
one attribute to a line. 

Status information for finished and moved jobs can be displayed 
using the 
.I -x
and 
.I -H 
options.

When displaying job status information, the
.B qstat
command will display status information about all 
.I job_identifiers
and 
.I destinations
specified.

If your job has been moved to another server through peer scheduling, 
give the job
ID as an argument to qstat.  If you only give the 
.B qstat
command, your
job will not appear to exist.  For example, your job 123.ServerA
is moved to ServerB.  In this case, use
.RS 5
qstat 123
.RE
or
.RS 5
qstat 123.ServerA
.RE
To list all jobs at ServerB, you can use:
.RS 5
qstat @ServerB
.RE
If ServerB is your default server, and your job started at 
ServerA but was moved to ServerB, you must use
.RS 5 
qstat 123.ServerA
.RE
to see the job.


Users without manager or operator privilege cannot view custom
resources which were created to be invisible to users, whether 
these resources are server, queue or job attributes.

.SH OPTIONS

.B Job Status
.IP "-E" 10
Groups jobs by server and displays jobs sorted by ascending ID.  When
.B qstat
is presented with a list of jobs, jobs are grouped by server and each 
group is displayed by ascending ID.
.IP "-J" 10
Limits status information to job arrays.
.IP "-t" 10
Displays status information for jobs, job arrays, and subjobs.
When used with 
.I -J
option, limits status information to subjobs.

.IP "-p" 10
The 
.I Time Use 
column is replaced with the percentage completed for the job.  For an 
array job this is the percentage of subjobs completed.  For a normal
job, it is the larger of percentage used walltime or percentage used CPU time.
Default format used.

.IP "-x" 10
Displays status information for finished and moved jobs in addition to running and 
queued jobs.

.LP
The following options will cause the alternate job status format to be used:
.IP "-a" 10
All queued and running jobs are displayed.  
If a 
.I destination
is given, information for all jobs at that 
.I destination
is displayed.
If a 
.I job_identifier
is given, information about that job is displayed.  
Always specify this option before the 
.I -n 
or 
.I -s
options, otherwise they will not take effect.
.IP "-H" 10
Without a job identifier, displays information for all finished or moved jobs.
If a job identifier is given, displays information for that job regardless of 
its state.
.IP "-i" 10
If a 
.I destination
is given, information for queued, held or waiting jobs at that 
.I destination
is displayed.
If a 
.I job_identifier
is given, information about that job is displayed regardless
of its state.  
.IP "-r" 10
If a 
.I destination
is given, information for running or suspended jobs at that 
.I destination
is displayed.
If a 
.I job_identifier
is given, information about that job is displayed regardless of its state.  
.IP "-u user_list" 10
If a 
.I destination
is given, status for jobs at that 
.I destination 
owned by users in 
.I user_list
is displayed.
If a 
.I job_identifier
is given, status information for that job is displayed regardless of the job's 
ownership.
.sp
Format: username[@host] in comma-separated list.  Hostnames may be wildcarded, but not domain names.
When no hostname is specified, username is for any host.
.IP "-n" 10
The exec_host string is listed on the line below the basic information.
If the 
.I -1
option is given, the exec_host string is listed on the end of the same line.
If using the 
.I -a 
option, always specify the
.I -n 
option after
.I -a
otherwise the
.I -n 
option will not take effect.
.IP "-s" 10
Any comment added by the administrator or scheduler is shown on the line below the basic information.
If the 
.I -1 
option is given, the comment string is listed on the end of the same line.
If using the 
.I -a 
option, always specify the
.I -s 
option after
.I -a
otherwise the
.I -s

.IP "-T" 10
Displays estimated start time for queued jobs, replacing the 
.I Elap Time
field with the 
.I Est Start 
field.  Jobs with earlier estimated start
times are displayed before those with later estimated start times. 
This sorts the jobs to show the order in which they will be executed.

Running jobs are displayed before other jobs.  Running jobs are sorted
by their 
.I stime 
attribute (start time).

Queued jobs whose estimated start times are unset
(estimated.start_time = unset) are displayed after those with
estimated start times, with estimated start time shown as a dash
("-").  Queued jobs with estimated start times in the past are treated
as if their estimated start times are unset.

Time displayed is local to the qstat command.  Current week begins on
Sunday.

The following table shows the format for the Est Start field when the
.I -w 
option is not used:

.IP " " 10

.fi

.IP " " 10
When used with the 
.I -f 
option, prints the full timezone-qualified start time.

If a job's estimated start time cannot be calculated, the start time
is shown as a question mark ("?").

This option can be made unavailable to unprivileged users.  

.IP "-w" 10
