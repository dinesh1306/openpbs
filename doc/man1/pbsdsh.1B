.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B pbsdsh
command executes (spawns) a normal application program on one or
more nodes under control of
the PBS.  
.B pbsdsh 
uses the Task Manager
API to distribute the program on the allocated nodes.
.LP
When run without the -c or the -n option, 
.B pbsdsh 
will spawn the program
on all nodes allocated to the PBS job.  The spawns take place concurrently \-
all execute at (about) the same time.

Note that the double dash must come after the options and before the 
program and arguments.  The double dash is only required for Linux.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c copies"
The program is spawned 
.I copies
times on the nodes allocated, one per node, unless
.I copies 
is greater than the number of nodes.
If this is true,
it will wrap around, running multiple instances on some nodes.
This option is mutually exclusive with 
.I -n.
.IP "-n node_index"
The program is spawned only on the 
.I node_index -th
node allocated.  This option is mutually exclusive with 
.I -c.
.IP -s
The program is run in turn on each 
node, one after the other.
.IP -v
Produces verbose output about error conditions and task exit status.
.IP -o
No obit request is made for spawned tasks.  The program will not wait for
the tasks to finish.
.IP --version
The 
.B pbsdsh
command returns its PBS version information and exits.
This option can only be used alone

.SH OPERANDS
The first operand,
.I program ,
is the program to execute.  The double dash must precede the 
.I program 
under Linux.
.LP
Additional operands,
.I program_args ,
are passed as arguments to the 
.I program.

.SH STANDARD ERROR
The 
.B pbsdsh 
command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
each error occurrence.
