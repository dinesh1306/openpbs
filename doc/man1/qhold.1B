.SH NAME
.B qhold 
\- hold PBS batch jobs


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qhold
[\-h hold_list]
job_identifier_list
.br
.B qhold
--version


.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B qhold 
command requests that a server place one or more holds on
a job.  A job that has a hold is not eligible for execution.
Supported holds: 
.I USER ,
.I OTHER
(also known as operator),
.I SYSTEM, 
and 
.I bad password.
.LP
A user may place a
.I USER 
hold upon any job the user owns.
An operator, who is a user with operator privilege, may place either a
.I USER 
or an
.I OTHER
hold on any job.  The batch administrator may place any hold on any job.
.LP
The 
.I p
option can only be set by root or admin user via 
.B qhold -h p.
The owning user can release with 
.B qrls -h p
or query by 
.B qselect -h p.
.LP
If no 
.I "\-h"
option is given, the
USER 
hold will be applied to the jobs described by the 
.I job_identifier_list
operand list.
.LP
If the job identified by
.I job_identifier_list
is in the queued, held, or waiting
states, then all that occurs is that the hold type is added to the job.
The job is then placed into the held
state if it resides in an execution queue.
.LP
If the job is 
running, then the result of the 
.B qhold 
command depends upon whether the job can be checkpointed.
The job can be checkpointed if the OS supports checkpointing, or 
if the application being checkpointed supports checkpointing.  See
the 
.B PBS Professional Administrator's Guide.
If the job can be checkpointed, then:
.RS 5
The job is checkpointed and its execution is interrupted.

The resources assigned to the job are released.

The job is placed in the held state in the execution queue.

The job's Hold_Types attribute is set to 
.I u
for User Hold.
.RE

A job's dependency places a system hold on the job.  When the
dependency is satisfied, the system hold is removed.  This system hold
is the same as the one set by an administrator.  If the administrator
sets a system hold on a job with a dependency, then when the
dependency is satisfied, the job becomes eligible for execution.

If checkpoint / restart is not supported, 
.B qhold 
simply sets the
job's Hold_Types attribute to 
.I u.  
The job continues to execute.
.LP

If the job is in the process of provisioning, it is not held.

The 
.B qhold 
command can be used on job arrays, but not on subjobs or ranges of 
subjobs.
