.TH pbs_hook_attributes 7B "26 February 2015" Local "PBS Professional"
.SH NAME
.B pbs_hook_attributes 
\- attributes of PBS hooks

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Hook attributes can be set, unset, and viewed using the 
.B qmgr 
command.
See the 
.B qmgr(1B) 
man page.

An unset hook attribute takes the default value for that attribute.

Under UNIX/Linux, root privilege is required in order to operate on
hooks.  Under Windows, this must be done from the installation
account.  For domained environments, the installation account must be
a lo cal account that is a member of the local Administrators group on
the local computer.  For standalone environments, the ins tallation
account must be a local account that is a member of the local
Administrators group on the local computer.

.B The following hook attributes can 
.B be set by the administrator:

.IP "alarm=<n>"
Specifies the number of seconds to allow a hook to run before
the hook times out.

Valid values: >0
.br
Format: Integer
.br
Default value: 30

.IP "debug"
Specifies whether or not the hook produces debugging files under
PBS_HOME/server_priv/hooks/tmp or PBS_HOME/mom_priv/hooks/tmp.  Files
are named hook_<hook event>_<hook name>_<unique ID>.in, .data, and .out.
Format: Boolean.
Default value: False.

.IP "enabled=<t|T|1|true|f|F|0|false>
Determines whether or not a hook is run when its triggering event occurs.
If a hook's 
.I enabled
attribute is "True", the hook is run.
.br
Format: Boolean
.br
Default: True

.IP "event=<event_string_array>"
List of events that trigger the hook.  Can be operated on with 
the "=", "+=", and "-=" operators.
.br
Valid events: "queuejob", "modifyjob", "movejob", "resvsub", "runjob",
"periodic", "provision", "execjob_begin", "execjob_end", execjob_prologue",
"execjob_epilogue", "execjob_preterm", "execjob_launch", "execjob_attach", 
"exechost_startup", "exechost_periodic", "" (meaning
no event)
.br
Format: string array 
.br
Default value: "" (meaning none, i.e. the hook is not triggered)

.IP "fail_action"
Specifies the action to be taken when hook fails due to alarm call or
unhandled exception, or to an internal error such as not enough disk
space or memory.  Can also specify a subsequent action to be taken
when hook runs successfully.  Value can be either "none" or one or more of 
"offline_vnodes", "clear_vnodes_upon_recovery", and "scheduler_restart_cycle". 
If this attribute is set to multiple values, scheduler restart happens last.
See the Hooks chapter in the PBS Professional Administrator's Guide.
Format: string_array.  Default value: "none".

.IP "freq"
Number of seconds between periodic or exechost_periodic triggers.
.br 
Format: integer
.br
Default: 120 seconds

.IP "order=<n>"
Indicates relative order of hook execution, for hooks sharing a trigger.
Hooks with lower values for 
.I n
execute before those with higher values.
Does not apply to periodic or exechost_periodic hooks.
.br
Format: integer
.br
Default value: 1

.IP "Type = {site}"
Valid values: "site"
.br
Format: string
.br
Default value: "site"

.IP "user=<user type>
Specifies who executes the hook.  If the value is "pbsadmin", the hook
executes as root.  If the value is "pbsuser", the hook executes as the
